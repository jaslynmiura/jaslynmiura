## Hi! I'm Jaslyn Miura👋

I am an Environmental Data Science Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB! I've been advancing my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, geospatial analysis, and data visualization to help establish impactful solutions.

I'm a University of Washington alum! I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management, with a minor in Quantitative Science.

I grew up on the island of Hawaiʻi, surrounded by a diverse community that deeply cares for the land, which has motivated me to use data-driven solutions to address environmental problems my home faces.
